      "contents": "\r\nI am a researcher and data analyst with years of experience conducting quantitative and qualitative research in laboratory, field, and online settings. Currently, I work at the University of California, Santa Barbara as a Ph.D. Candidate in Psychological & Brain Sciences where I employ advanced statistical methods to interpret data gathered from surveys, experiments, and large datasets from multiple, collaborative projects. These methods include A/B testing, logistic and linear regressions, univariate and multivariate analyses, and multi-level modeling using statistical software packages such as R, Python, MATLAB, and Excel. I maintain a robust and reproducible workflow using version-controlled projects with Github and use R Markdown and Jupyter Notebook to write and share reports.\r\nI am interested in building my research and data science toolbox by staying actively involved in the Software Carpentry, RStudio, and TidyTuesday communities. I plan to continue learning advanced methods for analyzing and communicating data, such as Bayesian analysis, forecasting, and other machine learning methods. Please check out the website tabs for my portfolio and blog to learn more.\r\nThroughout my many years as a scholar and educator working in multiple research laboratories, I have learned that open communication, collaborative teamwork, and compassionate support are paramount in generating quality scientific research. I hope to apply the skills I have developed to help solve real-world problems upon graduating.\r\nAcademic Research\r\nIn my research as a Ph.D. Candidate in the Psychological & Brain Sciences Department, I work with Emily G. Jacobs, Ph.D. to investigate the role of sex steroid hormones on spatial navigation abilities and strategies in midlife women and men. The midlife period is characterized by declining ovarian hormone production as women transition to menopause and behavioral and cognitive changes unfold, a natural process known as reproductive aging. My research aims to investigate the influence of declining sex steroid hormones on brain regions that are crucial for supporting successful spatial navigation performance.\r\nThe outcomes of my research have practical importance and benefits to society that lead to greater advancement in educational, psychological, and medical fields — including understanding healthy brain aging, advancing knowledge for the intersection of women’s health and neuroscience, and identifying early cognitive markers for dementia.\r\nDonning on proper PPE (white lab coat, safety goggles, and latex gloves) to centrifuge blood, aliquot serum, and store cryovials into our freezer for future hormone assays. Being a female scientist is a pretty cool job!Outside of the lab, I enjoy participating in community outreach events at science fairs, hosting laboratory tours, and teaming up with the local chapter of Girls Inc., an organization dedicated to introducing young girls to STEM. Together, these experiences continue to solidify my commitment to fostering the growth of my community and in sharing science with the public throughout my career. Please see my publications and scientific communications tab to learn more!\r\nPersonal\r\nIn my free time, I love watching YouTube, making art, and baking pastries and sweets with Asian-inspired flavors. I am a proud first-generation college student and first-generation American, and am continually finding ways to re-establish connections to my roots and joining communities to preserve and share my family’s stories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Grad Slam is an annual and UC-wide public speaking competition that brings the campus community together and spotlights the amazing research being done by graduate students. Graduate students present their research in 3-minute talks that are clear, direct, and engaging to diverse audiences.\r\nPassword: GradSlam23\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Crossroads\r\nAs part of my Crossroads fellowship, I worked with three other graduate student fellows and four advising professors to design an interdisciplinary pedagogy on the topics surrounding my academic research that investigates the overlap between sex hormones, aging, and spatial navigation. The results were multi-part videos that explained why there are sex differences in spatial navigation from the perspective of four main disciplines: neuroendocrinology, cognitive psychology, human geography, and biological anthropology. The goal of the videos was to present them to undergraduate students and diverse audiences who would benefit from applying course concepts to tangible research, in addition to thinking critically about how science is contextualized across multiple disciplines.\r\nI conceptualized the ideas of the teaching videos during the spring and summer of 2019, designed and reviewed the layout of the presentations, directed the content and goals of the videos, wrote scripts, and did voice-overs for two of the videos. I drew inspiration from TED-Ed style videos and produced the video that explains the research question from the perspective of a neuroendocrinologist:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo watch the other videos, please see the playlist on YouTube. The recommended order to watch the videos are:\r\nIntroduction\r\nCognitive Psychology\r\nEndocrinology\r\nBiological Anthropology\r\nHuman Geography\r\n\r\n  Lunch & Learn\r\nMy recorded talk for UC Santa Barbara Graduate Division’s Lunch & Learn Series on September 2021. This series is a monthly informal seminar that recruits one graduate student from the STEM discipline (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) and one graduate student from SHEF discipline (Social Science, Humanities, Education, and Fine Arts) to present their research the way they want to a smart, friendly, and non-specialist audience of peers.\r\nPassword: LunchLearn2021\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOutreach\r\nBelow is a sample of some community outreach events I have participated in during my time at UC San Diego and UC Santa Barbara.\r\n  MOXI Science Museum\r\nThe MOXI, The Wolf Museum of Exploration + Innovation is a Santa Barbara science museum that emphasizes interactive exhibits. With my team in Dr. Emily Jacobs’ lab, I helped organize outreach events at MOXI to teach patrons about the brain using interactive demonstrations (trivia) and hands-on learning (holding real brains). Both children and adults love touching the brains and always learn something new!\r\nMOXI Member Mornings\r\nThe Jacobs Lab was invited in 2019 to a MOXI’s Member Mornings event. These take place once a month and are a time where members can come to the museum before it opens and enjoy some additional programming. The had food vendors, a face painter, and several Halloween themed activities such as a scavenger hunt, pumpkin seed guessing contest, DIY potion making, and pumpkin decorating. We provided the brains (on par with the Halloween theme) in the forms of trivia, anatomy, and coloring sheets!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMOXI Afterparty\r\nThe Jacobs Lab was invited in 2018 to host a booth at MOXI’s Afterparty, which is an event for adults to enjoy the science museum during the evening in a fun atmosphere with drinks, games, and prizes. We provided rodent, cow, and sheep brains for patrons to hold, and shared fun brain facts through trivia questions we put together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Fleet Science Museum\r\nWith the support of a university research fellowship during the summer of 2014, I and my colleagues at the Research on Autism and Development Laboratory (RADLab) at UC San Diego collaborated with the Fleet Science Center, a local science museum, to develop an educational model that blends research and outreach in an informal learning environment. While using interactive demonstrations to collect balance data from museum patrons, we taught them that balance is a motor skill that changes across the lifespan. Because our research team was all female (mainly women of color), we also made an effort to signal to our patrons, especially young girls, that there is no stereotypical model of what a scientist should look like. Our published manuscript is based on the results of our data and our experience in bridging the communication gap between scientists and the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
