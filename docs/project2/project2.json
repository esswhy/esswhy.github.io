Counts of annual juvenile snowshoe hare traps were visualized to explore number of hares observed throughout the course of the study. Body weights of juvenile snowshoe hares were visually compared by sex across three different live trap sites (Bonanza Mature, Bonanza Riparian, and Bonanza Spruce Stand), and weights between females and males overall were statistically compared. Finally, the relationship between body weight and hind foot length for juvenile hares was also explored.\r\nData and Methods\r\nSnowshoe hare physical data was collected from 1998 - 2012 and made available by Dr. Knut Kielland and colleagues as part of the Bonanza Creek Long Term Ecological Research (BNZ LTER) project in interior Alaska (Kielland et al., 2017). Live trap sites included the Bonanza Mature, Bonanza Riparian, and Bonanza Spruce Stand locations which varied by vegetation. The dataset contains 378 unique observations of juvenile snowshoe hares collected during mainly the months of June, August, November, and March for each year from 1999 - 2012 (Kielland et al., 2010). Study phase originally took place from 1998 - 2002, but recorded data collection for juvenile hares began in 1999 and data collection efforts continued after the initial publication of the dataset. Thus, this exploratory data analysis report will include all the available data so far for juvenile hares.\r\nFollowing exploratory data visualizations, weight comparison between juvenile female and male hares was conducted using a two-sample, unpaired t-test with a significance level (\\(\\alpha\\)) or threshold of 0.05. The difference in means between the two groups was described using Cohen’s d effect size. The relationship between juvenile hare weight and hind foot length was explored by simple linear regression. Diagnostic plots were assessed to determine the fit of the linear model. All analyses were conducted in R version 4.1.1 and RStudio version 1.4.1717.\r\nPreliminary Results\r\nAnnual Juvenile Hare Trap Counts\r\n\r\n\r\nCode\r\n\r\n########## Read in the data \r\n\r\nhares <- read_csv(here(\"_projects\", \"data\", \"bonanza_hares.csv\"))\r\n\r\n#Check data\r\n#head(hares)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n########## Clean data\r\n\r\nhares <- hares %>% \r\n  \r\n  #Format MM/DD/YY date to YYYY-MM-DD\r\n  mutate(date = mdy(date)) %>% \r\n  \r\n  #Rename variables to include units\r\n  rename(weight_g = weight,\r\n         hindft_mm = hindft,\r\n         age_group = age)\r\n\r\n#Check data\r\n#head(hares)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n########## Filter juvenile hares\r\n\r\nhares_j <- hares %>% \r\n  \r\n  #Filter for juvenile hares\r\n  filter(age_group == \"j\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n########## Count juvenile hare traps by year\r\n\r\nhares_j_trap_counts <- hares_j %>% \r\n  \r\n  #Create year column\r\n  mutate(year = year(date)) %>% \r\n  \r\n  #Group by year\r\n  group_by(year) %>% \r\n  \r\n  #Summarize trap counts\r\n  summarize(trap_counts = n())\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n########## Trap count statistics \r\n\r\n#Descriptive statistics for juvenile trap counts\r\nhares_j_trap_counts_stats <- hares_j_trap_counts %>% \r\n  summarize(min_trap = min(trap_counts),\r\n            max_trap = max(trap_counts),\r\n            mean_trap = mean(trap_counts),\r\n            median_trap = median(trap_counts),\r\n            sd_trap = sd(trap_counts))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n########## Trap counts plot by year\r\n\r\n#Bar plot\r\nggplot(data = hares_j_trap_counts, aes(x = year,\r\n                                       y = trap_counts)) +\r\n  \r\n  #Define bar plot\r\n  #Change fill color\r\n  geom_col(fill = \"skyblue\") +\r\n  \r\n  #Relabel x-axis and y-axis\r\n  labs(x = \"\\nYear\",\r\n       y = \"Frequency\\n\") +\r\n  \r\n  #Add text for y-values\r\n  #Change text color\r\n  #Adjust vertical text placement and text size\r\n  geom_text(aes(label = trap_counts),\r\n            color = \"grey50\",\r\n            vjust = -0.5, size = 3) +\r\n  \r\n  #Scale x-tick marks in intervals of 1 from 1999-2012\r\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1999, 2012, 1)) +\r\n  \r\n  #Scale y-tick marks in limits of 0-140\r\n  #Scale y-tick marks in intervals of 20 from 0-140\r\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 140),\r\n                     breaks = seq(0, 140, 20)) +\r\n  \r\n  #Change theme\r\n  theme_classic() +\r\n  \r\n  #Add custom theme\r\n  #Change y-axis text size\r\n  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 11),\r\n        \r\n        #Change axes title size and make bold\r\n        axis.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1. Counts of the total juvenile snowshoe hare trappings from 1999 - 2012. Numbers above each bar plot represent the total count of snowshoe hares trapped for that year. There were no records of hare trap counts for the years 2002 and 2009. Data source: Kielland et al. (2017).\r\n\r\nOne average, the number of juvenile hare trappings was 31.5 hares across the 14 years (1999 - 2012), with a standard deviation of \\(\\pm\\) 35.9 hares. The median annual trap count was 18.5 hares. The number of hare trappings ranged from 2 - 126, with the lowest count recorded in 2010 and the highest count recorded in 1999. Snowshoe hares are reported to have population fluctuations of 8 - 11 years due to vegetation and predator densities in interior Alaska (Kielland et al., 2017). According to the researchers of the study, the snowshoe hare density observed was highest in 1999 and declined thereafter (Kielland et al., 2017), which is consistent with the exploratory figure shown above (Figure 1).\r\nTo standardize juvenile hare population counts moving forward, the researchers could trap hares monthly for each year the study took place rather than just mainly four months each year. Additionally, setting traps on consistent dates per month would help with standardizing the juvenile hare population counts (i.e., traps set on October 30th and November 30th, not October 30th and November 1st). The researchers should also set the same number of traps each year, with the same number of traps evenly divided between each trap site. Additionally, considering other variables like different trap sites and sex could explain different juvenile hare populations seen over the years.\r\nJuvenile Hare Weights by Sex and Trap Site\r\n\r\n\r\nCode\r\n\r\n########## Subset data for juvenile hare weights\r\n\r\n#Hare weights\r\nhares_j_weights <- hares_j %>% \r\n  \r\n  #Group by sex and site\r\n  group_by(sex, grid) %>% \r\n  \r\n  #Rename sites and sex \r\n  mutate(grid = case_when(grid == \"bonbs\" ~ \"Bonanza Spruce Stand\",\r\n                          grid == \"bonmat\" ~ \"Bonanza Mature\",\r\n                          grid == \"bonrip\" ~ \"Bonanza Riparian\"),\r\n         sex = case_when(sex == \"f\" ~ \"Female\",\r\n                         sex == \"m\" ~ \"Male\",\r\n                         is.na(sex) == TRUE ~ \"Unknown\")) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n########## Plot weights by trap site and sex\r\n\r\n#Plot weights by site and sex\r\nggplot(data = hares_j_weights, aes(x = sex,\r\n                                   y = weight_g)) +\r\n  \r\n  #Define boxplot\r\n  #Remove fill color and outlier points\r\n  #Remove legend for redundancy\r\n  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = sex), alpha = 0.4,\r\n               outlier.color = NA,\r\n               show.legend = FALSE) +\r\n  \r\n  #Add scatter points\r\n  #Color by sex, add jitter width, change size and transparency\r\n  #Remove legend for redundancy\r\n  geom_jitter(aes(color = sex),\r\n              position = position_jitter(width = .1),\r\n              size = 2.0, alpha = 0.5,\r\n              show.legend = FALSE) +\r\n  \r\n  #Add mean value for each sex for each site\r\n  #Use point, change size and shape, change color and fill\r\n  stat_summary(fun = mean, \r\n               geom = \"point\", \r\n               shape = 20, \r\n               size = 4, \r\n               color =\"black\", \r\n               fill=\"black\") +\r\n\r\n  #Facet by site\r\n  facet_wrap(~ grid) +\r\n  \r\n  #Change x-axis and y-axis labels\r\n  #Change legent title\r\n  labs(x = \"\\nSex by Trap Site\",\r\n       y = \"Weight (g)\\n\",\r\n       color = \"Sex\") +\r\n  \r\n  #Use RColorBrewer color palette to fill boxplot\r\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Accent\") +\r\n  \r\n  #Use RColorBrewer color palette to fill jitter points\r\n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Accent\") +\r\n\r\n  #Change theme\r\n  theme_bw() +\r\n  \r\n  #Add custom theme\r\n  #Change axes text size\r\n  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 11),\r\n        \r\n        #Change axes title size and make bold\r\n        axis.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2. Female, male, and unknown sex of juvenile snowshoe hare weights (g) were observed across three different trap sites (Bonanza Mature, Bonanza Riparian, and Bonanza Spruce Stand) from 1999 - 2012. For the Bonanza Spruce Stand site, snowshoe hares were only labeled as either female or male. Green (female), purple (male), and orange (unknown) points indicate individual observations for the weight of a juvenile snowshoe hare. Boxplot endpoints indicate the 25th and 75th percentile, and the black line within the boxplot indicates the median value while the black point within the boxplot indicates the mean value for each sex. Data source: Kielland et al. (2017).\r\n\r\nThe distribution for weights for each sex across the three trap sites appear to be mostly normal with some mean and median values very similar to each other, and also contain few outliers (Figure 2). There appears to be a mean and median difference in weights between juvenile female and male snowshoe hares. There were only a few juvenile hares whose sex were labeled as unknown, which are unconfirmed males (Kielland et al., 2017) present for Bonanza Mature and Bonanza Riparian sites but not for the Bonanza Spruce Stand site. In addition to potential sex differences in mean weights, there could also be differences in mean weights between the different trap sites. Further investigation, such as running statistical tests, would help determine whether these differences in weights are important and significant.\r\nJuvenile Weight Comparison by Sex\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCode\r\n\r\n########## Subset dataframe\r\n\r\n#Dataframe of only juvenile female and male hares\r\nhares_j_weights_sex <- hares_j %>% \r\n  \r\n  #Filter for females and males only\r\n  filter(sex %in% c(\"f\", \"m\")) %>% \r\n  \r\n  #Rename sex values\r\n  mutate(sex = case_when(sex == \"f\" ~ \"Female\",\r\n                         sex == \"m\" ~ \"Male\"))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n########## Vectors\r\n\r\n#Vectors for weight by sex, dropping rows with NA values for weight\r\nhares_m <- filter(hares_j_weights_sex, sex == \"Male\") %>% \r\n  drop_na(weight_g) %>% \r\n  pull(weight_g) \r\nhares_f <- filter(hares_j_weights_sex, sex == \"Female\") %>% \r\n  drop_na(weight_g) %>% \r\n  pull(weight_g) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n########## Descriptive stats saved as vectors\r\n\r\n#Mean and SD of weights by sex\r\n#Sample size for male and female groups\r\nhares_m_mean <- mean(hares_m)\r\nhares_m_sd <- sd(hares_m)\r\nhares_m_sample <- length(hares_m)\r\nhares_f_mean <- mean(hares_f)\r\nhares_f_sd <- sd(hares_f)\r\nhares_f_sample <- length(hares_f)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n########## Explore normality: plots\r\n\r\n#Histogram by sex\r\nhist_sex <- ggplot(data = hares_j_weights_sex, aes(x = weight_g)) +\r\n\r\n  #Define histogram\r\n  geom_histogram(aes(fill = sex),\r\n                 bins = 12, color= \"white\") +\r\n\r\n  #Facet by sex\r\n  facet_wrap(~ sex)\r\n\r\n##Female histogram looks relatively normal, while male \r\n##histogram looks bimodal. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#QQ Plot by sex\r\nqq_sex <- ggplot(data = hares_j_weights_sex, aes(sample = weight_g)) +\r\n  \r\n  #Define QQ and add line\r\n  geom_qq(aes(color = sex)) + geom_qq_line() +\r\n  \r\n  #Facet by class\r\n  facet_wrap(~ sex)\r\n\r\n##Female QQ plot show slight S-shaped pattern, and this \r\n##pattern is more pronounced in the male QQ plot. \r\n##This violates assumption of normality of the observations \r\n##for a parametric t-test. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n########## Explore normality: Shapiro-Wilks test\r\n\r\nhares_m_shapirotest <- shapiro.test(hares_m)\r\nhares_f_shapirotest <- shapiro.test(hares_f)\r\n\r\n##Results of Shapiro-Wilks test report a p < 0.05 for \r\n##female weights and p < .001 for male weights, indicating \r\n##that we can reject the null hypothesis that the distribution \r\n##of the data are not significantly different from normal \r\n##distribution.

The absolute difference in means is 90.5 g (about a 10% difference) and this difference is statistically significant (Welch’s two-sample t-test: t(325) = 2.7, p < 0). However, the magnitude of the effect size is small (Cohen’s d = 0.3), indicating that the effect may require further investigation. Thus, while there is a significant difference in weights between juvenile female and male snowshoe hares observed at Bonanza Creek, further metrics of comparisons would be required to determine the practical importance of this difference in mean weights.\r\nComparison Between Juvenille Weight & Hind Foot Length\r\n\r\n\r\nCode\r\n\r\n########## Exploratory\r\n\r\n#Exploratory plots for weight and hind foot length\r\n#Scatter plot, histogram, and correlation\r\nlm_explore <- hares_j %>% select(weight_g, hindft_mm) %>% \r\n  ggpairs()\r\n\r\n##Figures show that while weight is normally distributed \r\n##among all juvenile hares, the hind foot length is not. \r\n##The hind foot length distribution is negative or left-skewed \r\n##and appears to have two peaks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n########## Construct linear regression model\r\n\r\n#Linear regression model\r\nhares_lm <- lm(weight_g ~ hindft_mm,\r\n               data = hares_j)\r\n\r\n#Tidy format\r\nhares_lm_tidy <- tidy(hares_lm)\r\nhares_lm_glance <- glance(hares_lm)\r\n\r\n#Pearson's correlation\r\nhares_cor <- cor.test(hares_j$weight_g, hares_j$hindft_mm)\r\n\r\n#Tidy format\r\nhares_cor_tidy <- tidy(hares_cor)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n########## Model diagnostics\r\n\r\n#Model diagnostic plots in 2x2 grid\r\n# par(mfrow = c(2,2))\r\n# plot(hares_lm)\r\n\r\n##First and third plots show that the there is a pattern \r\n##of heteroscedasticity, as the residuals of the model are \r\n##not constant throughout the x-axis value (weight).

Relationship between weight (g) and hind foot length (mm) for each juvenile snowshoe hare sex with recorded data. Points indicate individual hare measurements (female = green circles; male = purple triangles; unknown = orange diamonds). Linear model summary: \\(\\beta_{1}\\) = 9.5 g/mm, p < .001, \\(R^2\\) = 0.3, Pearson’s r = 0.5). Data source: Kielland et al. (2017).\r\n\r\nAs a starting point, the relationship between hind foot length and weight was explored across sex (i.e., ignoring sex as a variable). Thus, further analysis is needed to compare the relationship between hind foot length and weight by sex, and should also include trap site as an additional variable.\r\nThe relationship between hind foot length and weight appears somewhat linear for juvenile snowshoe hares with recorded data, both across and within sex (Figure 3). Simple linear regression revealed that hind foot length significantly predicts juvenile snowshoe hare weight (F(1, 247) = 105.2, p < .001, \\(R^2\\) = 0.3), with an average slope of \\(\\beta\\) = 9.5 g/mm (i.e., for each one millimeter increase in hind foot length, we would expect an average increase in weight of 9.5 grams). The multiple \\(R^2\\) indicates that about 29.9% of the variance in body weight from the linear model is explained by hind foot length. Additionally, hind foot length and weight are moderately and significantly, positively correlated (Pearson’s r = 0.5, p < .001). Diagnostic plots (not included) reveal slightly non-normally distributed and heteroscedastic residuals for the linear model.\r\nThis suggests that despite the linear model being significant, there could be other methods or types of models to describe the association between juvenile hare weight and hind foot length rather than using a default linear relationship. The hares labeled as unknown sex have recorded low hind foot and low weight measurements that seem to be outliers that can skew the trend between the relationship of our two variables. When hind foot length is greater than 100 mm, weight appears to increase in grams at a more non-linear rate. Therefore, it might be useful to incorporate other variables in the model, such as sex, and consider non-linear types of models for this relationship between body weight and hind foot length.\r\nSummary\r\nExploratory data analysis reveals the following initial findings:\r\nThe highest count of juvenile hare trappings was observed in 1999 and counts for juvenile hare trappings decreased thereafter for subsequent years of the study\r\nVisualizing juvenile hare weights by sex and trap sites reveal possible differences in mean weights\r\nMale juvenile snowshoe hares have higher mean weights than female juvenile snowshoe hares. However, the effect size is small (Cohen’s d = 0.3) despite a significant difference in means\r\nHind foot length appears to be linearly related with weight for juvenile snowshoe hares, though diagnostic plots suggest using different a different model and/or adding covariates. The simple linear regression relationship is significant, with a slope (expected average increase in grams for weight with a one millimeter increase in hind foot length) of 9.52 g/mm\r\nFuture directions or next steps:\r\nCompare weights between juvenile female and male snowshoe hares using a non-parametric test (Mann-Whitney U test) to accomodate for violations of normality and equal variances\r\nConduct a one-way ANOVA to compare mean weights of juvenile hares between different trap sites\r\nRun a multiple linear regression model to understand the relationship between sex, trap site, hind foot length, and weight for juvenile hares\r\nReferences\r\nData and Literature\r\nFlora, B.K.
