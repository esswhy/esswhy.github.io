Exploratory data analysis was performed and two logistic regression models were built. Accuracy was used as a metric for which model was better in classifying palmetto species.\r\nResearch Question\r\nCan we correctly classify whether a palemtto species is either Serenoa repens or Sabal etonia? For binary logistic regression, we want to investigate whether the model can classify whether a palmetto belongs to species Serenoa repens or Sabal etonia using the variables plant height (cm), canopy length (cm), canopy width (cm), and number of green leaves. In other words, we want to investigate whether the model can significantly predict our outcome variable, palmetto species.\r\nNull hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)): The model does not significantly predict the log odds of species being equal to Serenoa repens. The \\(\\beta_j\\) coefficients are equal to zero for each \\(j\\text{th}\\) predictor variable.\r\nAlternative hypothesis (\\(H_1\\)): At least one of the predictors or explanatory variables significantly predicts the log odds of species being equal to Serenoa repens. At least one of the \\(\\beta_j\\) coefficients in the model is not equal to zero.\r\nData and Methods\r\nPalmetto plant species Serenoa repens and Sabal etonia were observed from the years 1981 - 2017 at the Archbold Biological Station in south-central Florida and made publicly available by Dr. Warren Abrahamson (Abrahamson, 2019). Seedlings were planted and survival, growth, and biomass of the two species of plants were measured. Maximum height (cm), widest length of the canopy (cm), widest width of the canopy (cm), and the number of green leaves were among the physical measurements of plant growth that were recorded.\r\nFollowing exploratory data visualizations, the relationship between species and other recorded measurements were investigated by binary logistic regression. 10-fold cross-validation was performed, and accuracy and AIC were used as metrics to compare two different models and choose the model with better performance. Sample size and proportion of species correctly classified by the final model are reported. All analyses were conducted in R version 4.1.1 and RStudio version 1.4.1717.\r\n\r\n\r\nCode\r\n\r\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE,\r\n                      fig.align = \"center\")\r\n\r\n#Attach libraries\r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\r\nlibrary(here)\r\nlibrary(broom)\r\nlibrary(AICcmodavg)\r\nlibrary(kableExtra)\r\nlibrary(ggtext)\r\nlibrary(patchwork)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResults\r\nExploratory Data Visualizations\r\n\r\n\r\nCode\r\n\r\n#Read in the data \r\npalmetto <- read_csv(here(\"_projects\", \"data\", \"palmetto.csv\"))\r\n\r\n\r\n#Clean the data\r\npalmetto <- palmetto %>% \r\n  \r\n  #Select relevant variables\r\n  select(height:green_lvs, species) %>% \r\n  \r\n  #Recode species vairable\r\n  #1 = Serenoa repens, 2 = Sabal etonia\r\n  mutate(species = case_when(species == 1 ~ \"Serenoa repens\",\r\n                             species == 2 ~ \"Sabal etonia\")) %>% \r\n  \r\n  #Change species as factor\r\n  mutate(species = as.factor(species)) %>% \r\n  \r\n  #Reame variables to add units\r\n  rename(height_cm = height,\r\n         length_cm = length,\r\n         width_cm = width,\r\n         green_leaves = green_lvs)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCode\r\n\r\n### Plot 1: height and length marginal distributions\r\n\r\n#Define color palette\r\npalmetto_colors <- c(\"slateblue1\", \"skyblue1\") \r\n\r\n#Create scatterplot and marginal distributions\r\nggplot(data = palmetto, \r\n       aes(x = length_cm, y = height_cm, \r\n           color = species)) +\r\n  \r\n  #Define scatter\r\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.50, size = 2) + \r\n  \r\n  #Change colors\r\n  scale_colour_manual(values = palmetto_colors) +\r\n  \r\n  #Change theme\r\n  theme_minimal() +\r\n  \r\n  #Change x-axis and y-axis labels\r\n  #Change legend title\r\n  labs(x = \"Canopy Length (cm)\",\r\n       y = \"Height (cm)\",\r\n       color = \"Species\") +\r\n  \r\n  #Change legend position\r\n  theme(legend.position = c(0.8, 0.15),\r\n        \r\n        #Bold title of legend\r\n        legend.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\r\n        \r\n        #Bold x-axis and y-axis label text, change size\r\n        axis.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 11))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1.

Violin plots for the distribution of canopy width (cm) for each palmetto species, Sabal etonia (purple) and Serenoa repens (blue). The violin plot outlines illustrate the kernel probability density such that the width of the shaded area represents the proportion of the data located there. The black point within the violin plot indicates the median width for each species. Data source: Abrahamson, 2019.\r\n\r\nInitial exploration of the data reveals certain physical traits between the two palmetto species. Height between the two species appear similar, but the Sereona repens plant species seem to have shorter canopy length (Figure 1). There is also a difference in the number of green leaves measured, with Sereona repens plants having larger range and variance with an average of 7.5 green leaves counted (Figure 2). The majority of Sabal etonia plants have on average 4.02 green leaves, and the variance appears smaller. For the final exploratory plot, the canopy width was examined between the species and their respective width distribution and median width appear to be similar (Figure 3). Based on these plots, plant height and number of green leaves are the most likely to be helpful in classifying palmetto species correctly.\r\nBinary Logistic Regression Model\r\nWe will build two binary logistic regression models to determine the probability of a plant being either Serenoa repens or Sabal etonia based on several predictor variables.\r\nModel 1: Log odds of palmetto species being Serenoa repens using plant height, canopy length, canopy width, and number of green leaves as predictor variables\r\nModel 2: Log odds of palmetto species being Serenoa repens using plant height, canopy width, and number of green leaves as predictor variables\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCode\r\n\r\n########## Build the models ##########\r\n\r\n### Model 1\r\n\r\n#Define model with formula\r\nfx1 <- species ~ height_cm + length_cm + width_cm + green_leaves\r\n\r\n#Create model\r\n#Sabal etonia is reference\r\nmod1 <- glm(formula = fx1, data = palmetto,\r\n            family = \"binomial\")\r\n\r\n\r\n### Model 2\r\n\r\n#Define model with formula\r\nfx2 <- species ~ height_cm + width_cm + green_leaves\r\n\r\n#Create model\r\n#Sabal etonia is reference\r\nmod2 <- glm(formula = fx2, data = palmetto,\r\n            family = \"binomial\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n########## K-fold cross-validation ##########\r\n\r\n### Define parameters\r\n\r\n#Set seed\r\nset.seed(244)\r\n\r\n#10 fold, k=10\r\nn_folds <- 10\r\n\r\n#Create vector whose length is same as number of rows in our df\r\nfold_vec <- rep(1:n_folds, length.out = nrow(palmetto))\r\n\r\n#Randomize\r\n#Assign new column the number from fold_vec (repeats of 1-10)\r\n#Each group of 10 gets assigned a number 1-10, to divide folds into 10\r\npalmetto_fold <- palmetto %>% \r\n  mutate(fold = sample(fold_vec, size = n()))\r\n\r\n\r\n### Prediction accuracy function\r\n\r\npred_acc <- function(x, y) {\r\n  accurate <- ifelse(x == y, 1, 0)\r\n  return(mean(accurate, na.rm = TRUE))\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n### Run cross-validation\r\n\r\n#Create empty dataframe \r\nresults_df <- data.frame()\r\n\r\n#Loop 10 folds for cross-validation\r\nfor(i in 1:n_folds){\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  #Create test and training sets\r\n  #90/10, train/test\r\n  kfold_test_df <- palmetto_fold %>% \r\n    filter(fold_vec == i)\r\n  kfold_train_df <- palmetto_fold %>% \r\n    filter(fold_vec != i)\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  #Train the 2 models on training set\r\n  kfold_model1 <- glm(formula = fx1, data = kfold_train_df,\r\n                      family = \"binomial\")\r\n  kfold_model2 <- glm(formula = fx2, data = kfold_train_df,\r\n                      family = \"binomial\")\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  #Test df\r\n  #Based on new model, use that to predict whether it is S.repens or not\r\n  kfold_pred <- kfold_test_df %>% \r\n    mutate(blr1 = predict(kfold_model1,\r\n                          kfold_test_df,\r\n                          type = \"response\"),\r\n           blr2 = predict(kfold_model2,\r\n                          kfold_test_df,\r\n                          type = \"response\")) %>% \r\n    \r\n    #Add a new column for predicted sepecies\r\n    mutate(pred1 = ifelse(blr1 > 0.50,\r\n                          \"Serenoa repens\", \"Sabal etonia\"),\r\n           pred2 = ifelse(blr2 > 0.50,\r\n                          \"Serenoa repens\", \"Sabal etonia\"))\r\n  \r\n  #Accuracy between true species and predicted species\r\n  #Use predict accuracy function\r\n  kfold_accuracy <- kfold_pred %>% \r\n    summarize(blr1_acc = pred_acc(species, pred1),\r\n              blr2_acc = pred_acc(species, pred2))\r\n  \r\n  #Combine accuracy to results df\r\n  results_df <- bind_rows(results_df,\r\n                          kfold_accuracy)\r\n  \r\n}\r\n\r\n########## Check mean accuracy of each model ##########\r\n\r\n#Mean accuracy\r\nacc_table <- results_df %>%\r\n  \r\n  #Get mean of accuracy\r\n  summarize(blr1_acc = mean(blr1_acc),\r\n            blr2_acc = mean(blr2_acc)) \r\n\r\n#Add row name\r\nrownames(acc_table) <- c(\"Mean Prediction Accuracy\")\r\n\r\n#Style in kable\r\nacc_table %>% \r\n  \r\n  #Change column names\r\n  kable(col.names = c(\"Model 1\", \"Model 2\"), \r\n        \r\n        caption = \"<b><\/b> Average prediction accuracy of palmetto species for Model 1 and Model 2 from 10-fold cross-validation.

Fitted logistic regression curve of the chosen model for the observed species, Sereona repens (blue points) and Sabal etonia (purple points), with probabilities of a palmetto species being Sereona repens and using number of green leaves as a predictor variable. Data source: Abrahamson, 2019.\r\n\r\nAll else being equal, the odds of a palmetto species being Sereona repens increases by a multiplicative factor of \\(e^{0.03} = 1.03\\) for every 1 centimeter increase in plant height. The odds of a species being Sereona repens decreases by a multiplicative factor of \\(e^{-0.05} = 0.95\\) for every 1 centimeter increases in canopy length. This means the the odds are about 5% less likely for the plant to be Sereona repens. Similarly, every 1 centimeter increase in canopy width leads to a decrease in the odds of species being Sereona repens by a multiplicative factor of \\(e^{-0.04} = 0.96\\). Finally, the odds of a species being Sereona repens to increase by a multiplicative factor of \\(e^{1.91} = 6.75\\) for every additional count of green leaves on the plant. Probabilities for Sereona repens are higher when observations report greater number of green leaves (Figure 4), otherwise probabilities are lower and likely to be Sabal etonia. This indicates that the number of green leaves on the plant is one of the best predictor variables for classifying palmetto species.\r\nClassification Accuracy of Final Model\r\n\r\n\r\nCode\r\n\r\n#Get total counts\r\nfinal_counts <- blr_fitted %>% \r\n  \r\n  #Use `across()` to obtain counts for variables that contian \"species\" name\r\n  count(across(contains(\"species\"))) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n########## Construct table for % classified ##########\r\n\r\n#Construct final table\r\nfinal_counts_table <- final_counts %>% \r\n  \r\n  #Make correct/incorrect label\r\n  mutate(classification_label = case_when(\r\n    (species == \"Sabal etonia\" & species_predicted == \"Sabal etonia\") ~ \"Correct\",\r\n    (species == \"Serenoa repens\" & species_predicted == \"Serenoa repens\") ~ \"Correct\",\r\n    (species == \"Sabal etonia\" & species_predicted == \"Serenoa repens\") ~ \"Incorrect\",\r\n    (species == \"Serenoa repens\" & species_predicted == \"Sabal etonia\") ~ \"Incorrect\"\r\n  )) %>% \r\n  \r\n  #Remove irrelevant variable\r\n  select(-species_predicted) %>% \r\n  \r\n  #Group by species and correctness\r\n  group_by(species, classification_label) %>% \r\n  \r\n  #Make wide format\r\n  pivot_wider(names_from = classification_label,\r\n              values_from = n) %>% \r\n  \r\n  #Make new column for percent correct\r\n  mutate(correct_pct = (Correct / (Correct + Incorrect)) * 100)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n########## Present table using kableExtra ##########\r\n\r\nfinal_counts_table %>% \r\n  \r\n  #Change column names\r\n  kable(col.names = c(\"Palmetto Species\", \"Sample Correctly Classified\",\r\n                      \"Sample Incorrectly Classified\", \"% Correctly Classified\"),\r\n        \r\n        caption = \"<b><\/b> Sample size and percentage of *Serenoa repens* and *Sabal etonia* palmettos correctly or incorrectly classified by our binary logistic regression model using four predictor variables (plant height, canopy length, canopy width, and number of green leaves).
