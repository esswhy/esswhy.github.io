I’m currently learning to create my own website in R, so thanks for your patience as this portfolio evolves and takes shape.\r\nI plan to use this website as a way to record just a tiny fraction of the amazing amount of things I am experiencing and learning during my Ph.D. program and hopefully throughout my data science career. This website will be an amalgamation of data science projects, personal reflections, and so forth.\r\nPlease don’t hesitate to reach out or say hello!\r\nWith appreciation,\r\nShuying\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
