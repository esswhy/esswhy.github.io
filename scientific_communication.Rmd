# Videos

`r mycounter_videos <- mycounter_videos +1; mycounter_videos`. &emsp; **Grad Slam**

My recorded presentation from UC Santa Barbara's 10th annual *Grad Slam Showcase* preliminary round on February 2023, in which I won runner-up. Grad Slam is an annual and UC-wide public speaking competition that brings the campus community together and spotlights the amazing research being done by graduate students. Graduate students present their research in 3-minute talks that are clear, direct, and engaging to diverse audiences.

`r mycounter_videos <- mycounter_videos +1; mycounter_videos`. &emsp; **Crossroads**

As part of my Crossroads fellowship, I worked with three other graduate student fellows and four advising professors to design an interdisciplinary pedagogy on the topics surrounding my academic research that investigates the overlap between sex hormones, aging, and spatial navigation. The results were multi-part videos that explained why there are sex differences in spatial navigation from the perspective of four main disciplines: neuroendocrinology, cognitive psychology, human geography, and biological anthropology. The goal of the videos was to present them to undergraduate students and diverse audiences who would benefit from applying course concepts to tangible research, in addition to thinking critically about how science is contextualized across multiple disciplines.

I conceptualized the ideas of the teaching videos during the spring and summer of 2019, designed and reviewed the layout of the presentations, directed the content and goals of the videos, wrote scripts, and did voice-overs for two of the videos. I drew inspiration from TED-Ed style videos and produced the video that explains the research question from the perspective of a neuroendocrinologist:

`r mycounter_videos <- mycounter_videos +1; mycounter_videos`. &emsp; **Lunch & Learn**

My recorded talk for UC Santa Barbara Graduate Division's *Lunch & Learn Series* on September 2021. This series is a monthly informal seminar that recruits one graduate student from the STEM discipline (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) and one graduate student from SHEF discipline (Social Science, Humanities, Education, and Fine Arts) to present their research the way they want to a smart, friendly, and non-specialist audience of peers.

# Outreach

Below is a sample of some community outreach events I have participated in during my time at UC San Diego and UC Santa Barbara.

`r mycounter_outreach <- mycounter_outreach +1; mycounter_outreach`. &emsp; **MOXI Science Museum**

The MOXI, The Wolf Museum of Exploration + Innovation is a Santa Barbara science museum that emphasizes interactive exhibits. With my team in Dr. Emily Jacobsâ€™ lab, I helped organize outreach events at MOXI to teach patrons about the brain using interactive demonstrations (trivia) and hands-on learning (holding real brains). Both children and adults love touching the brains and always learn something new!

*MOXI Member Mornings*

The Jacobs Lab was invited in 2019 to a MOXIâ€™s Member Mornings event. These take place once a month and are a time where members can come to the museum before it opens and enjoy some additional programming. The had food vendors, a face painter, and several Halloween themed activities such as a scavenger hunt, pumpkin seed guessing contest, DIY potion making, and pumpkin decorating. We provided the brains (on par with the Halloween theme) in the forms of trivia, anatomy, and coloring sheets!

*MOXI Afterparty*

The Jacobs Lab was invited in 2018 to host a booth at MOXI's Afterparty, which is an event for adults to enjoy the science museum during the evening in a fun atmosphere with drinks, games, and prizes. We provided rodent, cow, and sheep brains for patrons to hold, and shared fun brain facts through trivia questions we put together.

`r mycounter_outreach <- mycounter_outreach +1; mycounter_outreach`. &emsp; **Fleet Science Museum**

With the support of a university research fellowship during the summer of 2014, I and my colleagues at the Research on Autism and Development Laboratory (RADLab) at UC San Diego collaborated with the Fleet Science Center, a local science museum, to develop an educational model that blends research and outreach in an informal learning environment. While using interactive demonstrations to collect balance data from museum patrons, we taught them that balance is a motor skill that changes across the lifespan. Because our research team was all female (mainly women of color), we also made an effort to signal to our patrons, especially young girls, that there is no stereotypical model of what a scientist should look like. Our published manuscript is based on the results of our data and our experience in bridging the communication gap between scientists and the public.
