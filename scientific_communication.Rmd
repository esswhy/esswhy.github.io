# Videos


`r mycounter_videos <- mycounter_videos +1; mycounter_videos`. &emsp; **Crossroads**

As part of my Crossroads fellowship, I worked with three graduate students and four professors to design an interdisciplinary pedagogy on the topics surrounding my academic research that investigates sex hormones, aging, and spatial navigation. The results were multi-part videos that explained why there are sex differences in spatial navigation from the perspective of four main disciplines: neuroendocrinology, cognitive psychology, human geography, and biological anthropology. The goal of the videos were to present them to undergraduate students and diverse audiences who would benefit from applying course concepts to tangible research, in addition to thinking critically about how science is contextualized across multiple disciplines.

I conceptualized the ideas of the teaching videos, designed and reviewed the layout of the presentations, directed the content and goals of the videos, wrote scripts, and did voice-overs for two of the videos. I was responsible for creating the video that explains the research question from the perspective of a neuroendocrinologist:

To watch the other videos, please see the [playlist on YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRk7eVChv4aQj-mFQKxl_OB5o5LDgiCl9). The recommended order to watch the videos are:

- Introduction

- Cognitive Psychology

- Endocrinology

- Biological Anthropology

- Human Geography
