Hi there!

If you're reading this, it means you've found my blog. I'm currently learning to create my own website in R, so thanks for your patience as this portfolio takes shape.

I plan to use this blog page as a way to record just a tiny fraction of the amazing amount of things I am experiencing and learning during my Ph.D. program and hopefully throughout my data science career. It will be an amalgamation of data science projects, personal reflections, and so forth.

Please don't hesitate to reach out or say hello!

All the best,

Shuying
